# Online Lever Adaptation

This repository aims to bundle all the code and experiments for my Master's thesis on online adaptation in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). The thesis is jointly supervised by [Jakob Foerster](https://www.jakobfoerster.com) with support from his research group at [FLAIR](https://foersterlab.com) and [Arnoud Doucet](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~doucet/) from the Department of Statistics at the University of Oxford.
